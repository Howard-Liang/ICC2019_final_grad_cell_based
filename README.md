# ICC2019_final_grad_cell_based

## Description

This is a project for 2019 ic contest graduation group, which implements an IoT Data Filter (IOTDF) that can process large IoT data from the sensors, and output the result in real-time.


## Executing Program

A testbench code (./testfixture.v) and several golden data were provided by the contest host.  
The RTL behavior of the chip can be simulated by using the following command: 
```
$ source runall_rtl
```
To see the simulated wave form, use nWave
```
$ nWave &
```
to read the fsdb files generated by ncverilog.  

The gate-level circuit can be tested by using the following command:
```
$ source runall_syn
```
